I mean that findings from paradigms other than MOT generalize to MOT too.\nNot every field of psychology is like that. This is not a unified theory of tracking. That would be a different talk. This is broad empirical generalizations, the ingredients to a unified theory."

At the end of each trial, the targets moved behind occluders so that their identities were no longer visible. Participants were asked where a particular target (say, the cartoon rabbit) had gone - that is, which occluder it was hiding behind. This type of task had been dubbed “multiple identity tracking” by Oksama and Hyönä (2004). Performance was better than chance, but was worse than the standard MOT task of reporting target locations irrespective of which target a location belonged to.\nNot fully anticipated from other visual attention paradigms.
